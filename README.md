# XSLT for item TEI -> JSON processing

This is used for processing TEI item data into JSON format for the cudl-viewer.
It is used in the cudl data processing workflow, as a layer on the lambda function that converts item data.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE IS PRESERVED as this is referenced in the lambda code.
